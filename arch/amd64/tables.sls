;;; Generate frame size tables for stack unwinding

;; The stack unwinding tables are used when there is a hardware trap
;; (e.g. caused by taking the car of a non-pair). At the time of the
;; trap it is unknown which parts of the stack frame have live
;; references and which may contain any old junk. The error handler
;; needs to be able to invoke the GC, print stack traces, etc. If the
;; error occurs in the scheduler it is not possible to do online
;; liveness analysis, so these tables are used to simply remove the
;; frame in which the trap occurred.

;; It is assumed that traps can't happen outside the body of the
;; procedure (i.e. outside the instructions that adjust rsp), except
;; for the final jump in a tail call. The user of these tables must
;; recognize those indirect jump instructions. Procedures hand-written
;; in assembler must not create their own stack frames.

;; All cases in a case-lambda must have the same frame size, because
;; here they are grouped by the procedure/procedure-end marks.

;; XXX: These tables need to be extended by the online compiler later.

;; The idea is to pick out all the procedures in the text, sort them

;; frame sizes. The table is prepended to the data.
