@section Apropos

The @code{(loko apropos)} library exports procedures for looking up
symbols in environments.

@deffn Procedure apropos-list name [env]
Search the names of the environment @var{env} and all loaded libraries
for symbols containing the substring @var{name}, which can be a string
or a symbol.

If @var{env} is omitted then the default is to use the interaction
environment.

The returned list contains entries of these formats:

@itemize
@item
(@var{library} @var{symbol}) -- this means that @var{library} exports
the @var{symbol}. The library is loaded, but it may need to be
imported.

@item
@var{symbol} -- this means that @var{symbol} is available in @var{env}.
@end itemize

This procedure should be compatible with the similarly named one in
Chez Scheme.
@end deffn

@deffn Procedure apropos name [env]
This is an analogue of the @code{apropos-list} procedure that is meant
for interactive use.
@end deffn
